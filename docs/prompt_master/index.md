I am excited to introduce **PromptMaster**, a tool I am developing to simplify how users create and manage prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). PromptMaster aims to make interactions with AI clearer and more effective.

### Key Features:

- **Edit Button**: Click to have your prompt refined for clarity and effectiveness using the "Prompt Master" model.
- **Additional Tools**: Access extra prompt techniques from the sidebar to enhance your prompts further.

#### Project Management

- **Organized Folders**: Create projects that generate folders with "input" and "output" subfolders.
- **Save Easily**: Save your original and edited prompts in their respective folders.

#### Session Management

- **Save and Load**: Save your entire session, including all files and folders, and load them later to continue your work.

#### Output Modification

- **Editing Options**: Use tools to simplify language, specify formats, add context, and more.
- **Prompt Browser**: Browse and reuse previously saved prompts.
