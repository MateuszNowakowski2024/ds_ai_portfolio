Running Multiple Streamlit Apps with Tmux","text":""},{"location":"streamlit_aws/#step-41-virtual-environment","title":"Step 4.1: Virtual Environment","text":"<p>Do you need a virtual environment?</p> <p>Setting up a virtual environment on your EC2 instance introduces minimal overhead and is highly recommended for managing Python dependencies effectively, especially in multi-version scenarios. Here's a detailed comparison of the two approaches to help you decide:</p> <p>Option 1: Use Virtual Environments</p> <p>Pros: - Dependency Isolation: Virtual environments isolate dependencies for your Streamlit app, preventing conflicts with system-level packages or other projects. - Clean Environment: You can install libraries and tools specific to your app without cluttering the global Python environment. - Portability: If you need to replicate your environment on another instance, you can use the <code>requirements.txt</code> file to easily reinstall dependencies. - Best Practice: Using virtual environments is considered a best practice in Python development.</p> <p>Cons: - Minimal Overhead: While virtual environments consume some disk space (mainly for copied binaries and installed packages), this is generally negligible on modern EC2 instances. - Setup Steps: You need to create and activate the virtual environment before running your app, which adds a step to your workflow.</p> <p>Option 2: Use Global Python Installation</p> <p>Pros: - Simplicity: You directly use <code>python3.11</code> without additional setup for virtual environments. - Less Disk Usage: No duplicate copies of the Python binary or libraries are created.</p> <p>Cons: - Risk of Conflicts: Installing dependencies globally may cause conflicts with system Python packages or dependencies for other projects. - System Stability: There is a small risk of inadvertently installing or upgrading packages that affect system scripts or tools. - Difficulty in Maintenance: Managing dependencies globally can lead to a cluttered environment and challenges during upgrades or migrations.</p> <p>Recommendation</p> <p>For most Streamlit app setups, using a virtual environment is the better choice, even on a lightweight EC2 instance. Here's why: - The overhead of a virtual environment is negligible compared to the benefits of dependency isolation. - It prevents issues that may arise from global installations, such as version conflicts or unintended system changes. - It aligns with Python best practices, making your app more robust and easier to manage.</p> <p>If simplicity is your priority and you are confident the global installation won't cause conflicts (e.g., it's a dedicated EC2 instance for a single project), you can skip the virtual environment.
